V Kohli,caught,KC Sangakkara,UWMBCA Welegedara,9,1,Sri Lanka,Dhaka,5 Jan 2010," 6.5  great reflexes by Sangakkara! Comes round the wicket, Kohli tries to cheekily nudge it down to third man but gets a thick edge, Sanga falls to his right and catches it  62/2 ",12,19,1,0,75.00
V Kohli,lbw,,KMDN Kulasekara,12,1,Sri Lanka,Dambulla,18 Aug 2008," 7.5  lbw! Kulasekara pitches the ball on a good length just outside off stump and nips it back into the right-hander, Kohli gets half a stride forward and tries to drive, the ball beats the inside edge of the bat and crashes into the back pad in front of off stump, that is plumb and Doctrove sends Kohli on his way  23/2 ",22,33,1,0,54.54
V Kohli,lbw,,S Randiv,54,1,Sri Lanka,Nagpur,18 Dec 2009," 26.3  trapped in front. It turned in from outside off stump, Kohli walked across to try to work it to the on side for a single but missed it and was struck in line with the stumps. Hawk eye says it would have hit the top of the middle stump.  132/4 ",65,93,7,0,83.07
V Kohli,caught,KC Sangakkara,UWMBCA Welegedara,2,1,Sri Lanka,Dhaka,13 Jan 2010," 1.6  he's gone! poor shot, cuts away at a wide delivery without any feet movement, and edges it through, this one didn't come in with the angle, rather held its line. Kohli had been edgy through his brief stay, and such a loose shot was always around the corner  4/2 ",8,6,0,0,25.00
V Kohli,not out,,,71,2,Sri Lanka,Dhaka,10 Jan 2010,,68,98,9,0,104.41
V Kohli,caught,M Pushpakumara (sub),S Randiv,107,2,Sri Lanka,Kolkata,24 Dec 2009," 39.2  skips out and looks to dump this over long-on but ends up miscuing it, its up there for a while and the sub, Pushpakumara, settles under it and cups it just in front of the boundary, ending a very pleasing century from Kohli  247/3 ",114,0,11,1,93.85
V Kohli,caught,SR Watson,AC Voges,30,2,Australia,Vadodara,25 Oct 2009," 20.4  Virat is once again caught at long-off. We have seen that quite often in the IPL and Champions League games as well. He charged down the track but was beaten in flight, tried to go though with the shot and skied it up. Watson ran in from long-off to take a good catch  103/3 ",41,53,3,0,73.17
V Kohli,not out,,,102,2,Bangladesh,Dhaka,11 Jan 2010,,95,128,11,0,107.36
V Kohli,caught,GA Manou,DE Bollinger,10,2,Australia,Mohali,2 Nov 2009," 14.3  poor shot, Bollinger angles it outside off and cramps Kohli for a bit if room as he shapes to cut it square on the off side, he ends up getting a tame edge to the keeper  78/2 ",16,32,1,0,62.50
V Kohli,caught,Shakib Al Hasan,Shakib Al Hasan,91,2,Bangladesh,Dhaka,7 Jan 2010," 34.6  Shakib holds on to one this time, this one is flighted generously, Kohli - cramping - has to reach out for the drive, is not to the pitch of the ball, and ends up hitting it low and back to Shakib. Well played Kohli, Bangladesh have look-in again, just when it started to look like a cruise  203/4 ",102,136,7,0,89.21
V Kohli,bowled,,UWMBCA Welegedara,27,1,Sri Lanka,Rajkot,15 Dec 2009," 47.2  bowled him, a touch slower, 127ks, he is looking to hit this length delivery across the line and over midwicket, misses and is gone  386/7 ",19,20,4,0,142.10
V Kohli,not out,,,2,1,Sri Lanka,Colombo (RPS),14 Sep 2009,,2,6,0,0,100.00
V Kohli,caught,Umar Gul,Shahid Afridi,16,2,Pakistan,Centurion,26 Sep 2009, 21.3  Kohli rushes down the track and lofts it high towards long-off where Gul is stationed. Gul back-pedals to catch it but it bounds off his palms .. Gul swoops down to catch it but it again bounces off his palms but he nails it the third time!  126/3 ,24,28,1,0,66.66
V Kohli,not out,,,79,2,West Indies,Johannesburg,30 Sep 2009,,104,121,9,2,75.96
V Kohli (c),caught,JM Vince (sub),LE Plunkett,66,2,England,Birmingham,30 Jun 2019," 28.2  [rubs eyes] oh Virat... Steers a length ball to backward point! YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT! Another fifty but no cigar for Kohli, who has given England an opening just when things were beginning to get itchy! Eager to get bat on ball, maybe skidded through a touch, and Vince swallowed a fat outside edge  146/2 ",76,103,7,0,86.84
V Kohli (c),caught,Sarfaraz Ahmed,Mohammad Amir,77,1,Pakistan,Manchester,16 Jun 2019," 47.4  gone, is he? Pakistan have Kohli! Quick bouncer, too quick for Kohli, who tried to swivel and pull it to fine leg. Gets the faintest of edges, and a prolonged appeal moves the umpire's finger  314/5 ",65,105,7,0,118.46
V Kohli (c),caught,Rubel Hossain,Mustafizur Rahman,26,1,Bangladesh,Birmingham,2 Jul 2019," 38.2  short, and he has holed out to midwicket! That cutter again from Mustafiz that does the trick. May have stuck in the pitch for a bit more than Kohli expected. He was aiming for that short boundary once again, and he placed it right down Rubel's throat. Kohli falls for the first time in six knocks without getting to at least 50!  237/3 ",27,45,3,0,96.29
V Kohli (c),caught,DM Bravo (sub),JO Holder,72,1,West Indies,Manchester,27 Jun 2019," 38.2  Kohli's filthy with himself. He's just pulled a half-tracker to midwicket. It was short, seemed to stop a bit on the pitch. Didn't bounce as much too. Kohli got into position to pull but played it too early, had to also adjust for lack of bounce and the ball goes very tamely off the toe end. Comfortable catching height and he gobbles it up. Kohli can't believe it, but he has to walk back  180/5 ",82,146,8,0,87.80
V Kohli (c),caught,PJ Cummins,MP Stoinis,82,1,Australia,The Oval,9 Jun 2019," 49.5  length ball, outside off stump, and Kohli tries to slap a cut over point. But it's not in the gap, and the person in the deep comfortably takes this catch  348/5 ",77,128,4,2,106.49
V Kohli (c),caught,Rahmat Shah,Mohammad Nabi,67,1,Afghanistan,Southampton,22 Jun 2019," 30.3  that's the big one! A bit of extra bounce on a regulation off-break, that Kohli shapes to cut away. Gets the upper edge and it scoops up for point inside the circle. Rahmat Shah dives foward and completes the catch. Well? If India wanted to find out how well they can ride out a rough situation, they've got one now!  135/4 ",63,105,5,0,106.34
V Kohli (c),caught,AT Carey,MP Stoinis,20,2,Australia,Delhi,13 Mar 2019," 12.3  Kohli walks too! Extra bounce does the Indian captain. You'd have expected that from one of the big scary quicks but this is Marcus Stoinis! And boy is he thrilled. A back of a length delivery outside off - ripe for the cut shot, which is what Kohli tries - gets a bit of a top edge through to the keeper. Cross-seamed variation from the Australian allrounder and it does the trick  68/2 ",22,0,2,0,90.90
V Kohli (c),caught,Q de Kock,AL Phehlukwayo,18,2,South Africa,Southampton,5 Jun 2019," 15.3  this has to be the catch of the day, of the week, and maybe the tournament when we look back four weeks later!  Sensational, absolutely sensational from de Kock.  Kohli has a waft at this away from the body as Andile gets this to straighten a hint, there's extra bounce on this and so he gets a thick edge as he tries to run it down. The ball was on the rise but de Kock dived full length to his right to pluck this magical catch one-handed even as it kept going away from him.  54/2 ",34,44,1,0,52.94
V Kohli (c),caught,MP Stoinis,PJ Cummins,116,1,Australia,Nagpur,5 Mar 2019," 47.1  caught at deep square leg! Kohli can't believe he found the fielder! He's furious with himself. Short slower ball stopped in the surface a touch, he timed the pull shot well but just dragged it squarer than he intended, straight to Stoinis who holds on! The end of another masterful display.  248/8 ",120,0,10,0,96.66
V Kohli (c),bowled,,A Zampa,123,2,Australia,Ranchi,8 Mar 2019," 37.3  Zampa has the last laugh! It's the googly that gets Kohli. Full on middle, and spinning into Kohli. He tries to whip this off his toes to midwicket, but the ball goes under his bat, and clips leg stump. Kohli (as expected) is not happy at all  219/6 ",95,0,16,1,129.47
V Kohli (c),caught,IS Sodhi,TA Boult,43,1,New Zealand,Mount Maunganui,26 Jan 2019," 39.1  Boult's pace has done the trick. Kohli looks to take him on with the short ball, but is beaten for pace and ends up getting a thick, fat top edge and Sodhi takes a good catch at fine leg, running around the ropes to his right. Important moment in the game.  236/3 ",45,59,5,0,95.55
V Kohli (c),lbw,,A Zampa,44,2,Australia,Hyderabad (Deccan),2 Mar 2019," 16.6  he presses forward for a length ball that straightens into him, and it's not given. But Australia have referred this! Certainly looked close, and it has hit the pad first in fact! Should now be a question of the line of it...pitches in line, impact in line, and hitting the wickets. Massive wicket for Australia to have picked up!  80/2 ",45,0,6,1,97.77
V Kohli (c),caught,HM Nicholls,TA Boult,60,2,New Zealand,Mount Maunganui,28 Jan 2019," 31.1  nicely snapped by Nicholls! Another no-feet drive from Kohli at a length ball. Length ball pushed across him. Reaches out with his hands to try and get this over extra cover on the up. Nicholls times the jump perfectly as he holds on. That was coming down too as he took it behind his head, which suggests it could have been an offcutter from Boult. He was brought back for the wicket, and he gets it  168/3 ",74,94,6,1,81.08
V Kohli (c),caught,TWM Latham,LH Ferguson,45,2,New Zealand,Napier,23 Jan 2019," 28.4  caught behind! The Ferguson short ball works. And that's largely because it climbs up to his badge. Kohli's the kind to take on the short ball. If only to show bowlers they won't have their way. He's got out this way before, especially when his body's the target and sometimes even when the bouncer is straying down leg - as this is. Goes for the hook and gets a thin tickle through to the keeper.  132/2 ",59,59,3,0,76.27
V Kohli (c),caught,AT Carey,JA Richardson,7,1,Australia,Mohali,10 Mar 2019," 39.4  full ball, wide and he gets an outside edge to this. It's been taken by Carey, and Kumara Dharmasena is sending it upstairs. The soft signal is out for caught behind. The replays don't look conclusive at first glance, but there needs to be conclusive evidence to overturn this, remember. It's given out, and there won't be a century no. 42 for Virat Kohli here. Still lots of batting to come, of course...  266/3 ",6,0,1,0,116.66
V Kohli (c),caught,AT Carey,JA Richardson,46,2,Australia,Melbourne,18 Jan 2019," 29.6  edged and gone. Australia finally have a wicket. And it's BiiiiG! Kohli pushes way away from the body, Richardson tempting him with pace and width. Big, fat edge to Carey who holds on this time  113/3 ",62,0,3,0,74.19
V Kohli (c),caught,GJ Maxwell,JA Richardson,104,2,Australia,Adelaide,15 Jan 2019," 43.4  whoopsie. A huge moment for Australia, this. This is full, a half-volley on leg stump, and I don't know if Kohli was looking to hit this in the air, but he's flicked it, possibly a touch earlier than he wanted to, timed it perhaps better than he wanted to, and picked out the fielder at deep midwicket. With everyone back on the leg side, I doubt this was intentional  242/4 ",112,150,5,2,92.85
V Kohli (c),not out,,,33,2,West Indies,Thiruvananthapuram,1 Nov 2018,,29,57,6,0,113.79
V Kohli (c),caught,MP Stoinis,JA Richardson,3,2,Australia,Sydney,12 Jan 2019," 3.3  caught at square leg! Oh no! He's nailed this off his pads straight to Marcus Stoinis at forward square! It was 138kph, nearly a half-volley on leg stump, he pinged it off his pads but in the air, waist high, straight to Stoinis, he sucked his stomach in, it bobbled a touch but he clutched it tight!  4/2 ",8,10,0,0,37.50
V Kohli (c),caught,SD Hope,KAJ Roach,16,1,West Indies,Mumbai (BS),29 Oct 2018," 16.4  no hundred for Kohli today! Length ball outside off, and Kohli tries to dab this down to third man. Plays it inside the line of the ball as the ball seams away. Open face of the bat, and the delivery ensures it takes the outside of his bat. Stunned silence at the CCI  101/2 ",17,0,2,0,94.11
V Kohli (c),bowled,,MN Samuels,107,2,West Indies,Pune,27 Oct 2018," 41.3  bowled him! That should be the game. Kohli goes big, across the line. Looks for a big pull but the ball was drifting into him, and as a result, gets tucked up. Misses the ball altogether as it goes straight through and crashes into middle. Kohli had to take a chance against Samuels, and so he did. And he pays for it with his wicket. Top innings from the captain  220/7 ",119,0,10,1,89.91
V Kohli (c),lbw,,MM Ali,45,2,England,Lord's,14 Jul 2018," 26.6  appeal for lbw! And given by the man with the shield. Length ball on off that stays low, and with the ball hitting his front leg, the umpire has no hesitation in raising his finger. Kohli tries to play across the line, but he misses the shot. Moeen reaps the reward  140/4 ",56,0,2,0,80.35
V Kohli (c),not out,,,157,1,West Indies,Visakhapatnam,24 Oct 2018,,129,217,13,4,121.70
V Kohli (c),stumped,SD Hope,D Bishoo,140,2,West Indies,Guwahati,21 Oct 2018," 32.6  beautiful delivery! And Kohli isn't waiting. He knows he's stumped, and the Guwahati crowd rises to its feet. Full on middle, and spinning across Kohli. He tries to drive to cover, but he misses and Shai Hope whips the bails off. Kohli's back foot is nowhere near the crease, and replays say that Bishoo hasn't overstepped either  256/2 ",107,0,21,2,130.84
V Kohli (c),stumped,JC Buttler,AU Rashid,75,2,England,Nottingham,12 Jul 2018," 32.6  got him! That's a collector's item for Rashid! A beautifully flighted legbreak, dipping on Kohli, exploding past his edge, and Buttler's smart gloves seal the deal! A genuine legspinner's dismissal of a well-set batsman. It's something for England to cling to in the wreckage of their challenge in this contest  226/2 ",82,0,7,0,91.46
V Kohli (c),bowled,,AU Rashid,71,1,England,Leeds,17 Jul 2018," 30.1  oh, that's a ripper! Kohli is castled! He looks stunned... set and at ease, but suddenly gone. Rashid can dine out on this one for a while, a beautiful legbreak that has ragged from leg stump to smack off, beating his outside edge on the back foot! Kohli stares at the pitch, looks back at the bowler, then heads for the dressing room... How big a moment is that?  156/4 ",72,98,8,0,98.61
V Kohli (c),caught,DA Miller,CH Morris,75,1,South Africa,Johannesburg,10 Feb 2018," 31.1  caught at cover! The flay often works for Kohli, even when he tries to hit on the up, especially when he has so much room. But Morris, the fresh bowler, has a little more gas to hit the deck and get the extra bounce to knock over the India captain.  178/2 ",83,119,7,1,90.36
V Kohli (c),not out,,,129,2,South Africa,Centurion,16 Feb 2018,,96,123,19,2,134.37
V Kohli (c),not out,,,160,1,South Africa,Cape Town,7 Feb 2018,,159,220,12,2,100.62
V Kohli (c),not out,,,46,2,South Africa,Centurion,4 Feb 2018,,50,64,4,1,92.00
V Kohli (c),run out,,,36,1,South Africa,Port Elizabeth,13 Feb 2018," 25.3  it's another Rohit-Kohli run out. Kohli runs till the short of a good length area from the non-striker's end and has no chance of making it back after Rohit refuses the run. It's a length ball tapped pitch side off the back foot, in front of the stumps. Rohit takes a big step before realising he probably won't make it and calls no. By now, Kohli is already on his way. The fielder at point takes his time and hits the stumps with an under-arm throw on the bounce  153/2 ",54,76,2,0,66.66
V Kohli (c),caught,KS Williamson,TG Southee,113,1,New Zealand,Kanpur,29 Oct 2017," 46.4  taken at long-off! Southee profiting with the slower delivery again, this one comes off the back of the hand, asking Kohli to make all the pace himself. He tries to lift it, perhaps wider of the man on the boundary. But in the end, it carries straight down Williamson's throat  302/4 ",106,166,9,1,106.60
V Kohli (c),caught,TA Boult,TG Southee,121,1,New Zealand,Mumbai,22 Oct 2017," 49.2  six and out. But he's done his job, much more actually. It's shortish around off, Kohli uses his bottom hand to swing through the line, the ball lobs to long-on, where Boult takes a simple catch. A tired acknowledgement of the applause, what fitness, superb innings  270/7 ",125,203,9,2,96.80
V Kohli (c),caught,K Rabada,AL Phehlukwayo,112,2,South Africa,Durban,1 Feb 2018," 44.3  yet another slower bouncer. Yet another hoick under it. This time Rabada comes under it and snaps it up. Unlike Kohli to keep going after that, but Phehlukwayo's persistence has been rewarded. Nevertheless, it's a standing ovation for Kohli for yet another stunning second-innings knock  262/4 ",119,164,10,0,94.11
V Kohli (c),caught,MP Stoinis,A Zampa,39,2,Australia,Nagpur,1 Oct 2017," 39.4  such a good-looking shot, and it may have been six in Bengaluru, but here it's caught by long-off, comfortably. Tossed up on off stump, and he looks to loft this inside-out, ends up scooping it straight into the hands of long-off  227/3 ",55,73,2,0,70.90
V Kohli (c),bowled,,NM Coulter-Nile,21,2,Australia,Bengaluru,28 Sep 2017," 24.2  happens again. Kohli has done it again, it was always going to happen and I think Coulter-Nile was playing for that. Good length outside off, the ball seaming back in, Kohli tries to dab this down to third man, but it takes the inside edge and hits the off stump. That's another error from Kohli, and the worst thing is he has repeated the mistake from Kolkata. It is a nice shot to a ball that is slightly wide and when the ball isn't seaming in.  147/3 ",21,23,3,0,100.00
V Kohli (c),caught,TWM Latham,C de Grandhomme,29,2,New Zealand,Pune,25 Oct 2017," 13.5  caught behind, excellent work from Latham! It's the cross-seamer, which tends to bounce a touch more if the seam hits the pitch. Kohli, going for a drive, away from his body feathers a nick to the wicketkeeper, who has done really well, standing up. Rising with the ball, taking it ever so smoothly  79/2 ",29,40,3,1,100.00
V Kohli (c),not out,,,110,2,Sri Lanka,Colombo (RPS),3 Sep 2017,,116,0,9,0,94.82
V Kohli (c),caught,AJ Finch,AC Agar,28,2,Australia,Indore,24 Sep 2017," 34.3  eeks, he's picked out long-on has Virat Kohli. Very full from Agar outside off, Kohli sees the length and wants to go over cover, but the bat comes down straight, as opposed to from slightly leg side, which means the ball skews off the inside half and lobs to Finch at long-off. That's a rare mistake from Kohli, won't be happy with the dead ball either  203/3 ",35,58,2,0,80.00
V Kohli (c),caught,GJ Maxwell,NM Coulter-Nile,0,1,Australia,Chennai,17 Sep 2017," 5.1  Kohli can't get away. Maxwell at backward point pulls off a belting one-handed catch over his head. Kohli has been dismissed for a four-ball duck. This was full and wide - wider than a set of stumps outside off again. Kohli had left his first ball. He chased the second one with a big drive. The big drive comes out again, he slices it into the air. Maxwell propels himself at backward point, sticks out his right hand, and grabs the ball, and lands. Great reflexes from Maxwell  11/2 ",4,7,0,0,0.00
V Kohli (c),bowled,,NM Coulter-Nile,92,1,Australia,Kolkata,21 Sep 2017," 37.5  and chopped on! Kohli falls for 92. The ball has been seaming back in, Kohli chooses the wrong option of playing a dab down to third man, the ball takes the inside edge and hits the stumps. Maybe his first mistake of the day. Fantastic innings anyway  197/5 ",107,148,8,0,85.98
V Kohli (c),caught,PVD Chameera,MVT Fernando,3,2,Sri Lanka,Pallekele,27 Aug 2017," 5.1  gone! Fernando's got his man. Not the way he must have visualised getting the Indian captain out, but he won't care. It's not exactly a wicket-taking ball, on the pads and asking to be flicked. But Kohli's maybe a touch early on it, and maybe the left-armer's inswing makes him hit it finer than he'd like, and he ends up flicking in the air, to the man stationed at long leg. Chameera's the fielder, and he takes it brilliantly, diving forward as it dips on him  19/2 ",11,0,0,0,27.27
V Kohli (c),not out,,,111,2,West Indies,Kingston,6 Jul 2017,,115,0,12,2,96.52
V Kohli (c),not out,,,82,2,Sri Lanka,Dambulla,20 Aug 2017,,70,0,10,1,117.14
V Kohli (c),bowled,,A Dananjaya,4,2,Sri Lanka,Pallekele,24 Aug 2017," 17.3  Kohli's gone! 4 off 2! Dananjaya spinning a web around these Indian batsmen. What's happening. Yikes. Wow. Another googly, this one is soooo full but Kohli still does not manage to get bat on that. It's full and straight, Kohli takes his pads away from the line of the ball, looking for that trademark whippy cover drive, but all that does it create a massive bat-pad gap and the stumps are disturbed again. SL in raptures.  118/4 ",2,0,1,0,200.00
V Kohli (c),caught,EMDY Munaweera,SL Malinga,131,1,Sri Lanka,Colombo (RPS),31 Aug 2017," 29.3  gone! Malinga has his 300th wicket! Not the greatest delivery he's ever bowled, but he won't mind - he's found a way to break this partnership. A full, wide ball, and Kohli drives in the air, straight to the sweeper on the cover point boundary  225/2 ",96,0,17,2,136.45
V Kohli (c),caught,SD Hope,JO Holder,3,2,West Indies,North Sound,2 Jul 2017," 5.6  for the second match in a row, Holder has dismissed Kohli after troubling him with the short ball. Good bouncer, just outside off, similar to the one that he missed a few balls ago. This time he gets a top-edge that goes straight up, three storeys up, and Shai Hope takes a few steps forward and wraps his gloves around it  25/2 ",12,0,0,0,25.00
V Kohli (c),caught,KA Hope,JO Holder,11,1,West Indies,North Sound,30 Jun 2017," 9.3  oh good catch! Kyle Hope has made amends! Back of a length outside off stump, he's on the front foot early and then he sees this lift up off the pitch. It's chest height and he pokes at it. Thick outside edge that hangs to the left of gully for a moment, before the fielder there, Hope, leaps one-handed to his left and gets rid of Kohli. Holder has his man  34/2 ",22,0,2,0,50.00
V Kohli (c),not out,,,32,1,West Indies,Port of Spain,23 Jun 2017,,47,0,1,0,68.08
V Kohli (c),not out,,,76,2,South Africa,The Oval,11 Jun 2017,,101,136,7,1,75.24
V Kohli (c),not out,,,96,2,Bangladesh,Birmingham,15 Jun 2017,,78,96,13,0,123.07
V Kohli (c),caught,AR Nurse,AS Joseph,87,1,West Indies,Port of Spain,25 Jun 2017," 41.2  holes out to long-on looking for another big six. Slower ball from Joseph, rolls his fingers over the seam and the ball does not come on too well as a result. Tries to launch it and gets the elevation but not the distance. Nurse settles under it comfortably  285/5 ",66,0,4,4,131.81
V Kohli (c),caught,Shadab Khan,Mohammad Amir,5,2,Pakistan,The Oval,18 Jun 2017," 2.4  got him next ball. Amir, you legend! He takes flight. He punches the air like it spoke ill of his family. A fit, even a half fit bowler like him is worth tons for a team. This is back of a length, on off stump, and Kohli, looking to move across and flick into the on side gets a leading edge straight to point. Amir makes him play early. Amir sends him back. Amir puts a smile on Pakistan's face. Amir is making The Oval chant his name  6/2 ",9,11,0,0,55.55
V Kohli (c),caught,JC Buttler,BA Stokes,55,2,England,Kolkata,22 Jan 2017," 19.4  they get him outside off! With just enough nibble, keeping the ball up, tempting Kohli to play on the up, play an expansive shot and the cover drive becomes a thick edge, so much that Buttler has to jump up and take the catch almost above his shoulder. The umpires check the no-ball, Stokes is safe and India lose their captain  102/3 ",63,81,8,0,87.30
V Kohli (c),caught,BA Stokes,CR Woakes,8,1,England,Cuttack,19 Jan 2017," 2.6  Stokes nabs Kohli now. This is a huuuuuge scalp. Second slip dives low to his left and clings onto it with both hands. This is very, very full and wide outside off - a near yorker - Kohli reaches out and jabs his bat down on the ball. Takes the outside edge, Stokes is late to react but pouches it. No feet from Kohli. The Cuttack crowd has been hushed into silence  22/2 ",5,6,2,0,160.00
V Kohli (c),caught,DJ Willey,BA Stokes,122,2,England,Pune,15 Jan 2017," 36.2  oh Kohli for once has failed to finish off a chase. It's that man Stokes again, but is it too late? Kohli has played a modern classic here. Slower short ball, he looks to pull from outside off, and gets a top edge. Kohli knows he has made a mistake and his head falls away right away. Willey takes the catch at cover, and the crowd stands up for a great innings. Kohli acknowledges the crowd's response but he is bitterly disappointed he is not there when the winning runs are hit  263/5 ",105,147,8,5,116.19
V Kohli (c),not out,,,81,1,Pakistan,Birmingham,4 Jun 2017,,68,108,6,3,119.11
V Kohli,caught,MJ Guptill,IS Sodhi,65,1,New Zealand,Visakhapatnam,29 Oct 2016," 43.1  picks out long-off! He was placed wider, keeping in mind Kohli's ability to hit those inside out drives. That is the shot he goes for. Came down the track, took the ball on the half-volley and seemed to have struck it so well. The problem was it was straight at Guptill, who is perhaps New Zealand's best fielder. Kohli is livid as he walks off.  220/5 ",76,152,2,1,85.52
V Kohli (c),caught,N Dickwella,N Pradeep,0,1,Sri Lanka,The Oval,8 Jun 2017," 25.5  he's got him! Pradeep, you beauty, baiting Kohli outside off, and nabbing him easily. The shot is risky, with a slip in, but the batsman goes for the glide to third man anyway. A touch of seam movement away, but more importantly a little extra bounce, undoes him.  139/2 ",5,5,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,caught,BJ Watling,IS Sodhi,45,2,New Zealand,Ranchi,26 Oct 2016," 19.5  and gone. Kohli falls. Short and wide outside off, a terrible delivery. Kohli goes back and gets a thin edge which is well taken by Watling. Not much turn, but there may have been some extra bounce, or Kohli just played for some. Either way, what was turning into another typical Kohli chase has been cut short, almost literally.  98/2 ",51,64,2,1,88.23
V Kohli,not out,,,154,2,New Zealand,Mohali,23 Oct 2016,,134,202,16,1,114.92
V Kohli,not out,,,85,2,New Zealand,Dharamsala,16 Oct 2016,,81,109,9,1,104.93
V Kohli,caught,L Ronchi,MJ Santner,9,2,New Zealand,Delhi,20 Oct 2016," 11.4  gone. Kohli has been strangled down leg. Flat delivery down leg, Kohli flicks but gets just a thin edge which is wonderfully taken by Ronchi well down leg. Kohli has a smile on his face. Knew he hit that. Unfortunate way to go.  40/2 ",13,18,1,0,69.23
V Kohli,caught,MS Wade,JW Hastings,8,2,Australia,Sydney,23 Jan 2016," 20.2  out! Big, big wicket this. Very full and wide from Hastings. Kohli goes for the expansive drive and gets a thin nick through to the keeper. Wade takes it over his head. Australia are a delighted bunch. Huge moment in the game  134/2 ",11,11,1,0,72.72
V Kohli,caught,GJ Bailey,JW Hastings,117,1,Australia,Melbourne,17 Jan 2016," 46.2  Kohli steps out and hits it straight into the lap of extra cover. Hastings rolls his fingers across this slower one outside off, 120ks, Kohli slaps it to Bailey. Looked like a leg-breakish slower one. Kohli, who can't manufacture his own pace, is out for a run-a-ball 117  265/4 ",117,174,7,2,100.00
V Kohli,caught,AJ Finch,JP Faulkner,91,1,Australia,Perth,12 Jan 2016," 44.3  Kohli's hit that hard off the front foot, he's hit that flat, and the ball is headed over the long-on boundary but Finch runs to his left and takes the catch at head height. Kohli falls close to his hundred after an outstanding partnership. He's set India up for a huge total, but can the remaining batsmen hit from the get-go? Kohli timed that really well, just did not hit it high enough  243/2 ",97,148,9,1,93.81
V Kohli,caught,SPD Smith,KW Richardson,106,2,Australia,Canberra,20 Jan 2016," 39.1  Kohli finds the fielder. What is happening here? A nothing delivery from Richardson, fullish on leg. Kohli comes down the track and lobs a catch to mid-off. Just spooned up. Looked like a checked drive. Big big wicket. But, that has been a truly special innings from Kohli.  278/4 ",92,131,11,1,115.21
V Kohli,run out,,,59,1,Australia,Brisbane,15 Jan 2016," 23.5  what has happened there? Some hesitation and Kohli may be gone here. And he is gone. Kohli has to walk off after a fantastic innings. Against the run of play, Australia have a breakthrough. He stayed back to pummel a pull to fine leg. Richardson got around and rocketed a throw back to Wade, on the full, and Wade whipped off the bails. Kohli was found a foot short of his crease despite a dive.  134/2 ",67,84,4,0,88.05
V Kohli,caught,Q de Kock,K Rabada,138,1,South Africa,Chennai,22 Oct 2015," 48.2  that's the end of Kohli, he's caught behind for 138! Shortish ball going down leg and he pulled, got a faint edge and QdK took it easily  291/5 ",140,202,6,5,98.57
V Kohli,run out,,,12,1,South Africa,Indore,14 Oct 2015," 17.6  dropped at mid-off but there's a run out, what a horrible mix up, the two batsmen end up at non-striker's end! Kohli is out and he's absolutely livid! Rahane drove the ball down uppishly and in the air, Behardien leapt in the air and got both hands but it was a tough chance and it went down. The batsmen watch that and take one, then Kohli sprints back for the second while Rahane holds his hand up to say no but Kohli wants the run. Both are at the same end and the bails are taken off by the keeper. Kohli did make it on time and he was running to the danger end so looks like there was a run there  82/3 ",18,24,0,0,66.66
V Kohli,caught,M Morkel,DW Steyn,11,2,South Africa,Kanpur,11 Oct 2015," 39.6  has he been caught at short fine leg? What a take! Steyn bowled a half-volley on the pads, a delivery Kohli should have put away. He flicked the ball uppishly but it was dying on the tall Morne Morkel at short fine leg. Morkel got down low and caught the ball in his fingertips before it hit the ground. Is the tide turning decisively now?  214/3 ",18,29,0,0,61.11
V Kohli,caught,Q de Kock,K Rabada,7,2,South Africa,Mumbai,25 Oct 2015," 7.4  chases the wide one and edges it again! de Kock, take a bow. That is a catch that will be replayed forever. He might well be the best ODI keeper around right now. Rabada goes full, Kohli has to reach for it because he is lead-footed. It was a run-scoring opportunity because it is almost an overpitched delivery. But the extra pace seems to work against the batsman. Big nick, which means it hurtles between slip and the keeper. de Kock flings himself full length to his right and plucks it with one hand  44/2 ",6,11,0,1,116.66
V Kohli,bowled,,Shakib Al Hasan,25,1,Bangladesh,Dhaka,24 Jun 2015," 19.5  tries the big slog sweep, but the slowness of the wily Shakib has done him in. Kohli has not been fluent, but he needs to look at the scoreboard. The team is going at six an over. There is no need to play such expansive shots. He is too early into the slog sweep, and is beaten all ends up. Timbah  114/2 ",35,55,1,0,71.42
V Kohli,lbw,,Nasir Hossain,23,1,Bangladesh,Dhaka,21 Jun 2015," 12.3  lack of turn does Kohli in again. Fatally this time. There is a send-off here. Kohli is not happy. He stands there and looks at the Bangladesh fielders. If not a send-off, at least there is something said to him. First the delivery then. This is an offbresk, short of a length, pitches off, looks easy meat for at least a single to leg. Kohli plays for the turn, the ball not only doesn't turn, it also skids through to stay low. Plumb lbw  74/2 ",27,57,3,1,85.18
V Kohli,caught,DA Miller,M Morkel,77,2,South Africa,Rajkot,18 Oct 2015," 45.1  Morkel wins this moment. What a wicket this is. Is this the defining moment? Short on leg and Kohli can only heave the ball in the air to Miller at deep midwicket who takes a comfortable catch. This line, length and field placement has worked wonders so far. Stalled Kohli throughout the second part of his innings. Take a bow, Russell Domingo and AB de Villiers  216/5 ",99,155,5,0,77.77
V Kohli,caught,Mushfiqur Rahim,Taskin Ahmed,1,2,Bangladesh,Dhaka,18 Jun 2015," 17.2  Kohli has played a loose shot. That itch to feel bat on ball. The crowd has come alive. This is short of a length, wide, and Kohli just hangs his bat out. Even if he nails this nothing shot, he is not going to get a single off this. Which makes it an ordinary shot. And he has edged it. The roof comes off the stadium again, and game is on again. This is proving to be a superb ODI with all the twists and turns  101/2 ",4,9,0,0,25.00
V Kohli,caught,BJ Haddin,MG Johnson,1,2,Australia,Sydney,26 Mar 2015," 15.3  bouncer from Mitch, top-edged and gone - Kohli has cracked! Slow start, quick end for Virat, took on the Johnson short ball and emphatically lost. It was aimed across him, outside off, attempted to pull and sent a lusty blow straight up, Haddin had time to do a little square dance to his left, opened up the gauntlets and swallowed India's star man  78/2 ",13,11,0,0,7.69
V Kohli,caught,Mushfiqur Rahim,Rubel Hossain,3,1,Bangladesh,Melbourne,19 Mar 2015," 17.5  Kohli is gone. Bangladesh have a big wicket here. Delivers a fullish length delivery, pitched wide outside off, as Kohli is instinctively drawn into the drive, with the ball catching the outside edge to fly over to the keeper, who is able to take a good, low catch to this right to pluck a huge, huge wicket for the Bangla tigers. There was some away shape to the ball, which also played a part in the dismissal  79/2 ",8,6,0,0,37.50
V Kohli,bowled,,Sikandar Raza,38,2,Zimbabwe,Auckland,14 Mar 2015," 22.4  and out of nowhere Raza has produced a huge wicket as he gets Kohli bowled around his legs, as the batsmen looked for the sweep round the corner. Kohli looked absolutely befuddled once the gravity of the situation came to light. Has to go for another 30-odd score this World Cup. India in real disarray now  92/4 ",48,71,4,0,79.16
V Kohli,caught,MN Samuels,AD Russell,33,2,West Indies,Perth,6 Mar 2015," 14.6  gone! That was a better short ball on this pitch. Batsmen have struggled to pull from outside off on this pitch, and Kohli's no exception, had to meet it at shoulder height, top-edges it and he spoons it straight down the throat of the man at long leg  63/3 ",36,51,5,0,91.66
V Kohli,caught,JE Root,MM Ali,8,1,England,Perth,30 Jan 2015," 27.1  Moeen has struck, Kohli holes out to long off! He came down the track, lofted it straight down the ground and Root ran to his right to take a good running catch near the rope. Kohli hasn't built the innings at No. 3  103/2 ",19,26,0,0,42.10
V Kohli,caught,F du Plessis,Imran Tahir,46,1,South Africa,Melbourne,22 Feb 2015," 27.1  Tahir strikes with a long-hop! Kohli rocks back to pull, hits it straight to Faf at short midwicket, at chest height. He was sent spinning by the power of the shot, but clung on safely enough  136/2 ",60,106,3,0,76.66
V Kohli,not out,,,44,2,Ireland,Hamilton,10 Mar 2015,,42,64,4,1,104.76
V Kohli,not out,,,33,2,U.A.E.,Perth,28 Feb 2015,,41,49,5,0,80.48
V Kohli,caught,GJ Bailey,JP Faulkner,9,1,Australia,Melbourne,18 Jan 2015," 12.5  so easily done! Kohli has perished to his own attacking intent. It was just a shade short, barely had room to free the hands. Short-armed pull came out and ends up as a top edge which is taken by the captain jogging in from mid-on.  59/3 ",16,24,0,0,56.25
V Kohli,caught,JC Buttler,ST Finn,4,1,England,Brisbane,20 Jan 2015, 16.4  he is gone! The extra bounce has done him here. He looks to dab the back of length delivery towards third man but this rises up and catches the shoulder of the bat... It flies high and Buttler takes a good catch behind the stumps. That is an action replay of Kohli's dismissal in the first innings of the Brisbane Test  64/3 ,8,13,0,0,50.00
V Kohli,not out,,,3,1,Australia,Sydney,26 Jan 2015,,9,8,0,0,33.33
V Kohli,caught,Umar Akmal,Sohail Khan,107,1,Pakistan,Adelaide,15 Feb 2015, 45.2  Kohli is gone. Gets a wide half-volley that he is not quite close to. He edges it and Pakistan finally hold on to an offering from Kohli. Kohli raises his bat to the crowd as he walks off. Big innings in a big match  273/3 ,126,168,8,0,84.92
V Kohli (c),not out,,,139,2,Sri Lanka,Ranchi,16 Nov 2014,,126,192,12,3,110.31
V Kohli (c),caught,PLS Gamage,TM Dilshan,53,2,Sri Lanka,Hyderabad (Deccan),9 Nov 2014," 41.4  Kohli's holed out to long on as he looked to equal the scores with an attempted six, took a couple of steps out, made some room to a shortish ball and heaved it straight to long on  236/4 ",61,0,4,1,86.88
V Kohli (c),caught,S Randiv,S Prasanna,49,2,Sri Lanka,Ahmedabad,6 Nov 2014," 42.5  got him! That was nicely flighted outside off and Kohli came forward to drive. Dipped on him a bit and he hit it uppishly, and Randiv took a lovely low catch, diving forward  256/3 ",44,0,2,2,111.36
V Kohli,run out,,,127,1,West Indies,Dharamsala,17 Oct 2014," 49.6  the innings ends with a run-out.. Kohli misses the yorker but takes off for a bye.. Unlike Russell, Ramdin releases the ball early and Holder does the rest  330/6 ",114,164,13,3,111.40
V Kohli (c),caught,NLTC Perera,S Randiv,22,1,Sri Lanka,Cuttack,2 Nov 2014," 45.6  Kohli holes out and gives Randiv his third wicket on the last ball of his spell! It was a poor delivery, very short and on the leg side, Kohli pulled and only found the fielder in the deep at backward square leg  314/4 ",21,34,2,0,104.76
V Kohli (c),run out,,,66,1,Sri Lanka,Kolkata,13 Nov 2014," 38.5  Kohli has been run out, he is disgusted, smashes his bat into the ground, walks off in a huff, stares back at Rohit, it was a mishit of a slog in front of long on, fielder charged in for the catch, it bounced in front, but he did well to keep it from going past him, the throw came in to the keeper and there was no way Kohli would have made it, he was keen for the second, started, but hesitated as he saw the throw come in, but Rohit had almost reached him by then, can't really blame Rohit there  261/3 ",64,109,6,0,103.12
V Kohli,caught,MN Samuels,R Rampaul,62,1,West Indies,Delhi,11 Oct 2014," 40.4  flat strike from Kohli, and he's failed to clear Samuels on the edge of the long off rope, wasn't as full from Rampaul, and Kohli had to reach some way forward, scooped it powerfully, but Samuels does well, gets on his toes, and takes it in front of his head  196/5 ",78,124,5,0,79.48
V Kohli,caught,DJG Sammy,JE Taylor,2,2,West Indies,Kochi,8 Oct 2014," 9.5  this one straightens and Kohli's gone! He bowled it with the angle from outside off, it held its line a bit as Kohli went on the back foot to defend with an angled bat and the outside edge flew to Sammy at wide slip for a low catch near his right foot  55/2 ",5,7,0,0,40.00
V Kohli,caught,AN Cook,JM Anderson,13,2,England,Leeds,5 Sep 2014," 6.6  we have seen it a few times this summer! Eighth time this summer, Anderson gets Kohli. This is short of length just outside off, Kohli pokes at that from the crease and gets a thick outside edge. Cook at first slip dives low to his right and completes a regulation catch  25/2 ",21,25,2,0,61.90
V Kohli,not out,,,1,2,England,Birmingham,2 Sep 2014,,3,9,0,0,33.33
V Kohli,caught,JC Tredwell,BA Stokes,40,2,England,Nottingham,30 Aug 2014," 25.3  goodness me! Almost out of nowhere, Kohli has picked out mid-on. A full delivery and he tries to flick it through the leg side with plenty of bottom hand and only finds Tredwell. A few words are exchanged as Kohli ends off. A little heated out there all of a sudden  120/3 ",50,67,2,1,80.00
V Kohli (c),bowled,,Rubel Hossain,136,2,Bangladesh,Fatullah,26 Feb 2014," 45.4  Would you believe it! Bangla_fan's wish has come true. Rubel produces a wonderful yorker, aimed at the base of off, from nowhere and Kohli is a touch slow to bring his bat down. The off stump takes a beating..What an innings again! He didn't look like he was getting out tonight.. But this has come too late for Bangladesh  267/3 ",122,157,16,2,111.47
V Kohli (c),caught,Umar Akmal,Umar Gul,5,1,Pakistan,Dhaka,2 Mar 2014," 9.1  guides it straight into the keeper's hands and Gul is off with his best imitation of Shoaib Akhtar's aeroplane celebration. That is a big wicket and how softly it has fallen. Shortish ball outside off, Kohli tries to guide it away towards third man but gets too fine an edge. Bit more bounce and a touch of seam inward outs Pakistan on top  56/2 ",11,29,0,0,45.45
V Kohli,caught,PF Younghusband (sub),NL McCullum,82,2,New Zealand,Wellington,31 Jan 2014," 36.1  holed out at long-on and is that it for India? Tossed it up on middle and leg as Kohli charged him and lofts over the top. Watches it intently, hoping that it would  clear the substitute fielder but no such luck. Fighting innings from Kohli comes to an end  145/5 ",78,129,7,3,105.12
V Kohli (c),bowled,,BAW Mendis,48,1,Sri Lanka,Fatullah,28 Feb 2014," 26.3  Mendis has done it! the big one, his carrom ball has taken out Kohli's off stump, pitching on middle and slight movement away beats Kohli, I suppose these days getting Kohli for less than a half-century can be counted as a success, Kohli mimes how the ball moved as he walks off  130/2 ",51,66,4,1,94.11
V Kohli,caught,JDS Neesham,TG Southee,2,1,New Zealand,Hamilton,28 Jan 2014," 3.2  oh, he's gone! Kohli's top-edged a short ball! It was the first one he faced today and he went for the pull. I wonder if his weight was more on the front foot than it should have been, but the ball seemed to come at him a little quicker and all he can do is given an relatively easy skier to Jimmy Neesham at midwicket  5/1 ",10,14,0,0,20.00
V Kohli,caught,AN Cook,CR Woakes,0,1,England,Cardiff,27 Aug 2014," 7.4  that's all over! No relief for Kohli yet. He tries to take the aggressive option, comes down the pitch to Woakes and drives powerfully on the up but straight to Cook at mid-off. What a gift for England  19/2 ",3,1,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,caught,L Ronchi,HK Bennett,6,2,New Zealand,Auckland,25 Jan 2014," 14.5  and Bennett gets the Big One as he has Kohli, who was looking quite scratchy in his short stint, edge a good length ball from just outside off to the keeper, who takes the catch comfortably. Kohli knows it right away as he trudges back to the keeper, while Bennett kicks off some rather gregarious celebrations from the New Zealanders  74/3 ",20,27,1,0,30.00
V Kohli,caught,AP Devcich (sub),TG Southee,78,2,New Zealand,Hamilton,22 Jan 2014," 29.4  and Kohli is gone. You read that right. Kohli is out. Once again looking to slam this one through midwicket, but instead lines up long-on quite nicely as the substitute takes a good low catch to remove the cavalier batsman. Ends a sublime innings as he had another hundred for the taking  164/4 ",65,88,7,2,120.00
V Kohli,caught,JD Ryder,MJ McClenaghan,123,2,New Zealand,Napier,19 Jan 2014," 44.2  full toss outside off and out of all the deliveries to get him out, this turns out to be the one as he just lasers this to Ryder, who won't make the same mistake twice, as he takes this rather nonchalantly, while the rest of Napier erupts. The Napier crowd is good enough to stand up and applaud this sterling effort from the Delhi lad  237/7 ",111,179,11,2,110.81
V Kohli,caught,JH Kallis,R McLaren,31,2,South Africa,Johannesburg,5 Dec 2013," 14.4  safely pouched at first slip! Good delivery by McLaren, this was on a good length outside off, forced Kohli to play at it, ended up stabbing at the ball and the edge flew to Kallis at first slip  60/2 ",35,41,5,0,88.57
V Kohli,caught,Q de Kock,LL Tsotsobe,0,2,South Africa,Durban,8 Dec 2013," 3.5  and now Kohli is gone for a duck! Tsotsobe strikes with an angled delivery outside off which was slightly short in length. The batsman tried to steer it down to third man, but it just skims off the face of the bat to the keeper.  16/2 ",5,7,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,caught,J Charles,R Rampaul,19,2,West Indies,Kanpur,27 Nov 2013," 8.4  Kohli's gone in trying to leave the ball, it was a late decision, he was all set to defend this length delivery when he decided it was rising too much, tried to withdraw the bat but the ball brushed it and popped up to the keeper  61/2 ",18,19,3,0,105.55
V Kohli,caught,SP Narine,JO Holder,86,2,West Indies,Kochi,21 Nov 2013," 31.2  but he's gone now! Goes for one hit too many as he looks to loft the ball straight over the bowler's head, but mistimes it. Sunil Narine gets underneath the skier and holds on to a good catch to end Kohli's stay at the wicket. So he gets the record, but misses on his ton. But statistics aside, that was an immensely smooth innings  192/3 ",84,120,9,2,102.38
V Kohli,caught,JO Holder,R Rampaul,99,1,West Indies,Visakhapatnam,24 Nov 2013," 39.6  Kohli is out for 99, it was a bouncer at the head, Kohli pulled, the ball swirled down to fine leg, where the giant Holder dives forward to pluck it very low, then gets up and roars as Kohli stands stunned, they check for the no-ball but Rampaul is alright  209/5 ",100,159,9,0,99.00
V Kohli,run out,,,0,1,Australia,Bengaluru,2 Nov 2013, 19.5  Kohli is run out for a duck!! It was a touch fuller as Kohli drove it down towards mid-on and set off for the single. Rohit also started but said no a little too late and by then Kohli was a long way down. The fielder throws it to the keeper and bails are off with Kohli way out of his ground. Australia now have two big wickets in the bag  113/2 ,3,4,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,not out,,,115,2,Australia,Nagpur,30 Oct 2013,,66,104,18,1,174.24
V Kohli,caught,BJ Haddin,GJ Maxwell,68,1,Australia,Mohali,19 Oct 2013," 29.4  and Maxwell has done it, the massive wicket of Kohli who is dismissed for 68, Kohli gets on the front foot initially, then gets back and looks to power the ball through off, outside off and a thin edge through to the keeper, Kohli is frustrated at having given it away, India's lower order has a big task on their hands now  148/5 ",73,121,9,0,93.15
V Kohli,not out,,,100,2,Australia,Jaipur,16 Oct 2013,,52,82,8,7,192.30
V Kohli,lbw,,SR Watson,61,2,Australia,Pune,13 Oct 2013," 34.4  that's the end of Kohli! Watson, after sending a few short ones, slips in a length delivery and Kohli tries to whip this to square leg across the line. He is hit on the knee roll and that would have crashed into the leg stump. The umpire didn't waste any time. That looked plumb the moment it hit the pads. Australia on top here, excellent bowling from Watson again  166/5 ",85,121,6,0,71.76
V Kohli (c),caught,MN Waller,KM Jarvis,14,1,Zimbabwe,Harare,26 Jul 2013," 6.2  on a length on middle and off. Kohli tries to play through midwicket, and ends up spooning to Waller, who takes a catch. Kohli stands his ground and Malcolm Waller signals for a review from the umpire as it appears that the ball may have bounced before he took the catch. Just awaiting confirmation from the umpire. Hold on, it is out, and Kohli is walking back to the pavilion. It looked like it had not carried, but the umpires must have seen something that we didn't. Kohli is incensed as he walks back. This one will be talking point, that is certain.  35/2 ",18,35,2,0,77.77
V Kohli,caught,KC Sangakkara,RMS Eranga,2,2,Sri Lanka,Port of Spain,11 Jul 2013," 10.4  loud appeal for caught behind, which after some time, the umpire gives. There was a loud noise when the ball went past the bat and the only doubt was if that had carried to the keeper. Once the square leg umpire nodded, it was curtains for Kohli. Beautiful delivery again, on a length outside off and just straightening enough to take the outside edge. There wasn't not much of a forward stride by the batsman there  27/2 ",5,8,0,0,40.00
V Kohli (c),caught,V Sibanda,P Utseya,115,2,Zimbabwe,Harare,24 Jul 2013, 41.3  He's holed out in the deep! It was tossed up and Kohli came down the wicket again and struck it quite well. But Vusi Sibanda at long on takes a safe catch  216/3 ,108,133,13,1,106.48
V Kohli (c),caught,DJG Sammy,DJ Bravo,102,1,West Indies,Port of Spain,5 Jul 2013," 49.6  Kohli falls, but to the final ball of the innings. He gets a length ball, tries to clear deep midwicket, but can't. Just doesn't get the elevation on this. Kohli has done the job, though  311/7 ",83,120,13,2,122.89
V Kohli (c),caught,SL Malinga,AD Mathews,2,2,Sri Lanka,Kingston,2 Jul 2013," 15.5  big wicket, big wicket, Mathews digs it short into the body, Kohli hooks, and it is Malinga who takes it low on the fine-leg boundary, Kohli bangs bat into the ground as he departs  57/3 ",5,6,0,0,40.00
V Kohli,caught,CH Gayle,DJG Sammy,11,1,West Indies,Kingston,30 Jun 2013," 9.1  Gayle glorious at wide slip, what a catch, brings his big frame down to the right and plucks this thick edge one handed, Kohli went hard at this good length delivery and not surprisingly, it is that man Darren Sammy, again in the region outside off, it was angled in and swung away slightly, but rather poor stroke from Kohli, just tried to whack it away wildly  39/2 ",21,19,0,1,52.38
V Kohli (c),lbw,,HMRKB Herath,31,1,Sri Lanka,Port of Spain,9 Jul 2013," 20.3  Kohli is walking, it seems. This is plumb. Misses the length, and goes back to a full ball. To make it worse, this doesn't turn. Skids through, stays low, catches him dead in front  76/2 ",52,62,4,0,59.61
V Kohli,caught,RS Bopara,JM Anderson,43,1,England,Birmingham,23 Jun 2013," 18.3  gone this time...important blow for England which may just quell this late charge. Kohli tried to clear long-off, had a huge swing at a full delivery, it comes off the lower part of the bat, and Bopara steadies himself well under the chance  113/6 ",34,66,4,1,126.47
V Kohli,not out,,,58,2,Sri Lanka,Cardiff,20 Jun 2013,,64,80,4,1,90.62
V Kohli (c),not out,,,68,2,Zimbabwe,Harare,28 Jul 2013,,88,128,5,1,77.27
V Kohli,bowled,,SP Narine,22,2,West Indies,The Oval,11 Jun 2013," 19.6  through the gate! Kohli's cameo ends. Narine bowls from round the wicket, lands on off and middle and goes through with the angle, Kohli stays on the back foot and tries to work it to the on side, missed a straight one  127/2 ",18,18,4,0,122.22
V Kohli,caught,JC Tredwell,TT Bresnan,0,1,England,Dharamsala,27 Jan 2013," 3.4  caught at second slip! Action replay of the previous ball! Entices the new man with a floated delivery outside off, gets some away movement and Kohli, who went for the drive, edges it to Tredwell at second slip, this time to his left. Tredwell juggles it a few times before completing the catch.  13/2 ",1,1,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,not out,,,22,2,Pakistan,Birmingham,15 Jun 2013,,27,36,3,0,81.48
V Kohli,not out,,,77,2,England,Ranchi,19 Jan 2013,,79,110,9,2,97.46
V Kohli,caught,HM Amla,LL Tsotsobe,31,1,South Africa,Cardiff,6 Jun 2013," 34.2  India lose a wicket before the powerplay, the shot was on, and Kohli pulled the short ball, but he didn't time it and picked out Amla at the edge of the deep midwicket rope  210/2 ",41,46,2,0,75.60
V Kohli,caught,IR Bell,CR Woakes,37,1,England,Kochi,15 Jan 2013," 26.2  Kohli has holed out, he's thrown away a hard-earned start, stepping out and slicing a full delivery to the man at sweeper cover, he slams the bat into the ground and makes a disappointed-with-himself exit  119/4 ",54,86,1,1,68.51
V Kohli,caught,JC Tredwell,JC Tredwell,26,2,England,Mohali,23 Jan 2013, 16.5  success in the first over for Tredwell! He gets the big wicket of Kohli. That was tossed up on off stump and Kohli drives it softly back to the bowler. It went low to Tredwell who makes no mistake and completes the catch. Kohli walks away disappointed at that shot  72/2 ,33,44,3,0,78.78
V Kohli,bowled,,Junaid Khan,0,1,Pakistan,Chennai,30 Dec 2012," 5.4  off stump now! It's the big wicket. Fuller length, comes in after pitching on off, Kohli comes forward and like the previous delivery, doesn't cover the line of the ball well. He wasn't really sure of which way the ball was going to go, it comes back and hits the top of off. That's a big big wicket  19/3 ",5,9,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,caught,Younis Khan,Junaid Khan,7,1,Pakistan,Delhi,6 Jan 2013," 9.3  caught at second slip! the procession continues. Length ball, pitches on middle and goes across Kohli, who closes the face of the bat without either going forward or back, the ball takes an outside edge and flies low down to Younis at second-slip who completes a comfortable catch. India in deep mess again  37/3 ",17,25,1,0,41.17
V Kohli,caught,C Kieswetter,TT Bresnan,15,2,England,Rajkot,11 Jan 2013," 25.4  Kohli's tried to drive this length delivery through covers, took a step out and went hard at it, the ball used to race to the deep cover rope when he was in that insane form of his, now a thick edge has gone straight to the keeper  138/3 ",22,45,1,0,68.18
V Kohli,caught,HMRKB Herath,HMRKB Herath,38,2,Sri Lanka,Colombo (RPS),28 Jul 2012," 20.5  there's the wicket Sri Lanka were looking for, Kohli was looking to punch that short of length ball off the back foot, he tapped it straight back to Herath, who gleefully accepts the chance, it ws looking very easy for the Indian batsmen over the past hour or so  113/2 ",65,80,2,0,58.46
V Kohli,lbw,,N Pradeep,23,1,Sri Lanka,Pallekele,4 Aug 2012," 14.3  Trapped in front, Pradeep angled that in towards middle and leg, it moved in, Kohli likes to shuffle and more often than not he connects well, he missed it this time and was caught in front of middle and leg as he was trying to flick it into the leg side. The umpire checks for a no-ball, Pradeep's foot landed behind the line so Kohli has to go. Replays also show the ball would have clipped leg stump  77/2 ",35,42,2,0,65.71
V Kohli,caught,Kamran Akmal,Junaid Khan,6,2,Pakistan,Kolkata,3 Jan 2013," 11.6  and again in the midst of a superb spell, Junaid strikes with an ordinary ball, it was heading down the leg side, Kohli could have let it go, instead he tickles it down the leg side, Kamran Akmal - the source of so many cricket jokes over the past few years - pulls off a stunner, diving to his left to pluck that one, started moving early to anticipate that one, the dangerous Kohli is gone  55/2 ",9,12,1,0,66.66
V Kohli,caught,SMSM Senanayake (sub),NLTC Perera,106,1,Sri Lanka,Hambantota,21 Jul 2012," 39.6  Kohli has to go, a sharp catch at extra cover, was the slower one, Kohli picked it and struck it well, but he was looking to clear extra cover there but couldn't get the elevation, Sachitra Senanayake, the substitute fielder, presumably for Kulasekara, stayed alert and snapped it well  228/4 ",113,158,9,0,93.80
V Kohli,not out,,,128,2,Sri Lanka,Colombo (RPS),31 Jul 2012,,119,187,12,1,107.56
V Kohli,caught,Mohammad Hafeez,Umar Gul,183,2,Pakistan,Dhaka,18 Mar 2012," 47.1  a top edge ends Kohli's special knock! Like Rohit he tries to launch a length ball over the on side and gets a top edge that swirls to point, easily taken, he walks back to the applause, equals the highest score by an Indian batsman in a chase  318/4 ",148,211,22,1,123.64
V Kohli,caught,KC Sangakkara,NLTC Perera,1,1,Sri Lanka,Hambantota,24 Jul 2012," 5.3  Perera and all the Sri Lankans were convinced, and so was the umpire, after an eternity! Loose shot from Kohli, chasing a ball wide of the off stump, he tried to dab it away towards third man but the keeper detected an edge and went up immediately, it took the umpire Palliyaguruge a while to give that out, either way Kohli didn't look too pleased. He did look back though. Looking at the replays, there was a sound  33/2 ",5,6,0,0,20.00
V Kohli,caught,HDRL Thirimanne,MF Maharoof,108,1,Sri Lanka,Dhaka,13 Mar 2012," 42.5  and both men got their hundreds in the same over, and both men perished in the next, Virat wanted to carve this one over extra cover but he ended up finding sweeper cover  226/3 ",120,148,7,0,90.00
V Kohli,bowled,,Abdur Razzak,66,1,Bangladesh,Dhaka,16 Mar 2012," 35.5  inside edge! Loose shot from Kohli, it was a flatter delivery and Kohli made room to drive and ended up getting an inside edge to the base of the leg stump  173/2 ",82,126,5,0,80.48
V Kohli,not out,,,133,2,Sri Lanka,Hobart,28 Feb 2012,,86,133,16,2,154.65
V Kohli,lbw,,NLTC Perera,15,2,Sri Lanka,Adelaide,14 Feb 2012," 14.1  Kohli's trapped playing across the line, the ball lands on the off stump and nips back in slightly, Kohli tries to whip it away but the ball hits him a bit low on the pads, quite straightforward  61/2 ",25,32,1,0,60.00
V Kohli,caught,DT Christian,SR Watson,21,2,Australia,Sydney,26 Feb 2012," 15.6  Watson strikes in his first over. Full length ball, comes through much slower than it did when Lee was going whang. Kohli was lazy leaning across for the flick, he seemed to play it early and didn't keep it down. Straight to midwicket, and Watson is thrilled. Injury or not, his golden arm remains intact.  79/3 ",27,36,2,0,77.77
V Kohli,caught,DJ Hussey,BW Hilfenhaus,12,2,Australia,Brisbane,19 Feb 2012," 10.3  Appeal for a catch at slip, Kohli isn't sure if that carried to David Hussey at slip, outside edge travels low to Hussey's right and the catcher was certain he took it cleanly, the umpires have a chat and refer it upstairs, from the square leg angle it looked alright and the third umpire is convinced. Kohli doesn't look too pleased but he has to go  36/4 ",25,44,0,0,48.00
V Kohli,caught,KMDN Kulasekara,NLTC Perera,66,2,Sri Lanka,Brisbane,21 Feb 2012," 35.3  Perera gets the one that matters, Kohli is gone as he attempts the pull, horrible timing, the ball loops towards Kulasekara at mid-on, surely the end of India's chances  172/5 ",83,116,2,0,79.51
V Kohli,caught,PJ Forrest,CJ McKay,18,2,Australia,Adelaide,12 Feb 2012," 18.1  just when Kohli was looking set, he tries to go over the top of the off side, stays at the crease and doesn't get the elevation, Forrest takes it at sweeper cover  90/2 ",28,41,1,0,64.28
V Kohli,run out,,,77,2,Sri Lanka,Perth,8 Feb 2012," 35.6  Virat is down on the ground in pain, he might be gone too, a risky single it was going to be as he pushed to mid on and set off, a direct hit, and he is gone by miles, he is writhing in pain, but he will have to get up and walk back, needless single, it was the last ball of the over, did that have something to do with it? He is being helped off the ground now  181/6 ",94,156,8,1,81.91
V Kohli,caught,MN Samuels,A Martin,80,1,West Indies,Chennai,11 Dec 2011," 45.1  Kohli is gone. Looking to hit a six over long-on, but Martin sort of cramps him up with the leg line. He can't free the arms, and is too close to the ball, hence no elevation. easy catch for long-on  241/4 ",85,99,5,0,94.11
V Kohli,caught,RT Ponting,CJ McKay,31,2,Australia,Melbourne,5 Feb 2012," 11.2  Ponting at shortish backward point holds on to the screamer, Virat was batting superbly but he is gone now, cuts a wide delivery hard but straight to Ponting  64/3 ",34,30,3,0,91.17
V Kohli,caught,D Ramdin,R Rampaul,117,2,West Indies,Visakhapatnam,2 Dec 2011," 44.6  too bad he couldn't stay till the end! Kohli makes a bit of room to smash that down the ground but gets a feather edge to Ramdin, too late for Windies though, Kohli walks back cross with himself but he needn't be, it was another responsible innings from him, very pleasing to watch  247/4 ",123,154,14,0,95.12
V Kohli,bowled,,ST Finn,0,1,England,Kolkata,25 Oct 2011," 17.6  Kohli hasn't offered a shot and has lost off stump! That ball landed on a good length outside off stump and cut in off the pitch, Kohli moved forward and lifted his bat out of the way, only to the watch the ball come back at him and hit the top of off. It was too full to leave, so Kohli wouldn't have expected that to cut back off the pitch. Double strike from Finn.  80/2 ",5,5,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,bowled,,KAJ Roach,3,2,West Indies,Cuttack,29 Nov 2011," 6.3  Roach strikes again, Kohli is gone and we have a match on our hands! Roach nips this one in off the seam, Kohli gets across in a lazy manner without getting bat and pad close together and the ball darts through before he can drag the bat back in. It bounced a bit more too after hitting the seam to hit the top of the stumps. Kohli looks stunned.  47/3 ",6,13,0,0,50.00
V Kohli,not out,,,86,2,England,Mumbai,23 Oct 2011,,99,0,11,0,86.86
V Kohli,lbw,,GP Swann,35,2,England,Mohali,20 Oct 2011," 41.4  Swann strikes! Virat Kohli is out, beating by dip and massive spin off the surface. He played from the crease and was struck on the front pad. Did it spin too much? Sudhir Asnani doesn't think so, giving him out quickly. England are giving themselves a chance here  235/5 ",30,42,5,0,116.66
V Kohli,not out,,,23,1,West Indies,Indore,8 Dec 2011,,11,15,3,0,209.09
V Kohli,not out,,,112,2,England,Delhi,17 Oct 2011,,98,134,16,0,114.28
V Kohli,caught,C Kieswetter,JM Anderson,7,1,England,The Oval,9 Sep 2011," 10.2  Kohli's struggle has ended and this is now too easy for Anderson. He pitches just short of a length outside off and seams the ball away, Kohli stays in his crease and hangs his bat out, getting an edge to the wicketkeeper. Soft, soft dismissal. Anderson is having a terrific game, three wickets and a direct hit, in his 150th ODI.  25/4 ",18,18,0,0,38.88
V Kohli,hit wicket,,GP Swann,107,1,England,Cardiff,16 Sep 2011," 43.3  Hit-wicket, Kohli's gone, he rocked on the back foot to work that square and rocks back far enough to dislodge the bail on middle and leg stump, that's gone, Kieswetter spotted that and appealed and Kohli has to go after a delightful innings  236/4 ",93,102,9,1,115.05
V Kohli,caught,C Kieswetter,GP Swann,16,1,England,Lord's,11 Sep 2011," 25.2  Swann strikes, off his second ball, loose from Virat, trying to dab late against the turn, and gets the edge through to the keeper, Swann tossing it up on a length, and found some extra bounce which ultimately did Virat in  109/3 ",36,40,1,0,44.44
V Kohli,caught,IR Bell,GP Swann,9,1,England,Southampton,6 Sep 2011," 16.6  this is half mis-hit, half hung in the wind. Charges at Swann and hits this into the wind towards long-on, and finds Bell to perfection  125/3 ",9,9,0,0,100.00
V Kohli,caught,KP Pietersen,SR Patel,37,1,England,Hyderabad (Deccan),14 Oct 2011," 28.5  KP more than redeems himself for that misfield at long on earlier with a superb leaping take on the edge of the long off boundary, Kohli's look shows it all, he looks disgusted in disbelief, he had got to the pitch this time and lofted inside-out over extra cover but KP was around on the boundary and leaped two feet in the air to catch it  123/4 ",63,70,0,0,58.73
V Kohli,bowled,,SR Patel,55,1,England,Chester-le-Street,3 Sep 2011," 39.3  the perfect comeback! Samit pushes his next ball through a touch quicker, Kohli leans back for the cut, but under-edges onto his stumps!  206/4 ",73,92,4,0,75.34
V Kohli,stumped,CS Baugh,A Martin,22,2,West Indies,North Sound,13 Jun 2011," 20.6  stumped, was bowled flat and a little wider, Kohli made room to drive it through the off side, it turns away and misses the bat, Baugh collects well and takes off the bails in no time, good work with the gloves, Kohli has to go, his foot was in the air, big wicket  82/4 ",33,68,1,0,66.66
V Kohli,run out,,,94,1,West Indies,Kingston,16 Jun 2011," 35.6  there is going to be no century for Virat Kohli, he tried to come back for the second after another work off the pad towards deep square leg, but was caught short by an accurate throw from the deep, Ronnie Sarwan it is, Baugh makes no mistake in collecting and breaking the stumps, that looked like the only way he could have got out today  189/4 ",104,135,10,0,90.38
V Kohli,caught,KA Pollard,D Bishoo,81,2,West Indies,Port of Spain,8 Jun 2011," 30.6  holes out trying to finish it off quickly, comes down the track and hits that well but doesn't get enough elevation, cannot clear Pollard at long-off  173/3 ",103,118,6,1,78.64
V Kohli,caught,CS Baugh,R Rampaul,2,2,West Indies,Port of Spain,6 Jun 2011," 6.5  chasing a wide one and Kohli will be livid with that, short and he went for the cut, got a thin edge and Baugh made no mistake, a loose shot and he's paid the price  34/2 ",8,5,0,0,25.00
V Kohli,lbw,,DJG Sammy,0,2,West Indies,North Sound,11 Jun 2011," 7.4  well, well, Darren Sammy has brought the sparse crowd to life, he has snared Virat first ball, that harmless looking length ball that suddenly decides to nip back in sharply, Virat is caught on the crease and takes it on the pads, that looked to be going down leg, the umpire did not think so, in fact it would have bounced over as well as replays show, shocker that one but Virat is gone, what was that about the DRS again?  26/2 ",1,1,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,caught,MJ Clarke,DJ Hussey,24,2,Australia,Ahmedabad,24 Mar 2011," 28.3  Kohli has thrown it away totally against the run of play, full toss on the stumps, he threw his bat wildly at it, but only found the man at midwicket, David cannot believe it, he is smiling wildly, Virat is disappointed but he has to go  143/3 ",33,38,1,0,72.72
V Kohli,caught,Umar Akmal,Wahab Riaz,9,1,Pakistan,Mohali,30 Mar 2011," 25.2  Pakistan have taken a catch! Wahab strikes again! Caught at backward point. It landed on a length around off and angled away, Virat played a strange shot as if he was surprised by how it seamed away - Wahab hardly gets the ball to bend in - and had a weak waft at it. He just stabbed at it. Edge and pouched!  141/3 ",21,20,0,0,42.85
V Kohli,caught,RJ Peterson,RJ Peterson,1,1,South Africa,Nagpur,12 Mar 2011," 43.6  bizarre batting, Virat pushes the ball gently back to Peterson, a easy caught and bowled. South Africa are right back in this. Peterson flings the ball in celebration and they are pumped.  286/6 ",3,2,0,0,33.33
V Kohli,bowled,,R Rampaul,59,1,West Indies,Chennai,20 Mar 2011," 32.2  Rampaul does it again. Will this 'reverse' the momentum? Top bowling from Rampaul, gets it to nip in sharply from a length outside off. Kohli plonks the front foot across plays a swat-swipe across the line, rivalled in ugliness only by the shot Michael Clarke played yesterday. The ball sneaks past and upsets the furniture. It is one of Kohli's main scoring shots, but at times he doesn't pull it off that well.  173/3 ",76,128,5,0,77.63
V Kohli,lbw,,SP Narine,20,2,West Indies,Ahmedabad,5 Dec 2011," 8.2  Narine has his first international wicket, and it's the big onbe of Kohli, it was a length ball, an offspinner, Kohli looks to play it to the leg side, looked to have been struck on middle stump, umpire was convinced that would have taken leg, Kohli isn't, he doesn't like the decision one bit, but that doesn't matter, he's on his way, that was a tight call  43/3 ",30,21,3,0,66.66
V Kohli,bowled,,PW Borren,12,2,Netherlands,Delhi,9 Mar 2011, 14.3  Clatter! It landed full on a length around off stump line  and moved in a touch. Virat went for the off drive but drove outside the line and the ball went through the big gap to peg back the off stump  99/4 ,20,16,2,0,60.00
V Kohli,bowled,,TT Bresnan,8,1,England,Bengaluru,27 Feb 2011," 48.2  and another! Bresnan getting good reward for being England's best bowler. Yorker length, Kohli gives himself room, too much room in fact and it thuds into the base of off stump. Here comes Zaheer  327/7 ",5,12,1,0,160.00
V Kohli,not out,,,100,1,Bangladesh,Dhaka,19 Feb 2011,,83,113,8,2,120.48
V Kohli,caught,AB de Villiers,M Morkel,2,2,South Africa,Centurion,23 Jan 2011," 6.1  A rare failure for Virat Kohli. Morne does him with sheer pace. Back of a length and extra bounce from outside off, Kohli committed to the check-drive into the covers early. On second thoughts, he may have wanted to leave it. It is through him in a jiffy, taking the outside edge through to the keeper  31/2 ",6,11,0,0,33.33
V Kohli,not out,,,87,2,South Africa,Port Elizabeth,21 Jan 2011,,92,126,7,2,94.56
V Kohli,caught,AB de Villiers,M Morkel,28,2,South Africa,Cape Town,18 Jan 2011," 14.6  Morkel's persistence pays off, short of a good length but much closer to off stump this time with the right amount of nip, Kohli plays at that one and feathers it to the keeper, good consistent line from Morkel has reaped its reward  56/2 ",41,51,5,0,68.29
V Kohli,run out,,,22,1,South Africa,Johannesburg,15 Jan 2011," 17.5  Virat is run out  Out by miles. He pushed towards cover point and sets off for the run. He is sent back, and tries to dive back inside the crease but is not even in the frame. Miller swoops in to fire a direct hit. Clatter!  63/2 ",34,43,1,0,64.70
V Kohli,caught,GC Smith,DW Steyn,54,2,South Africa,Durban,12 Jan 2011," 29.3  Kohli perishes. Almost compelled to make the Powerplay count. Barring a miracle and a dream, this should be the end of India's challenge. Back of a length from Steyn, not there for the whip over the infield. Kholi goes for the shot, but can't time it well enough to clear Smith at midwicket in the circle, who hauls it in. End of a promising innings. Promised a bit today. Promised a lot for the future.  128/6 ",70,122,2,1,77.14
V Kohli,caught,LRPL Taylor,DL Vettori,2,2,New Zealand,Chennai,10 Dec 2010," 3.2  Dan gets his man now, it was fired in on the stumps, Virat chose to stay on the back foot, the ball went off the push to Taylor at slip who held on to the sharp take, game on here, bring it on!  10/2 ",8,10,0,0,25.00
V Kohli,run out,,,34,2,Ireland,Bengaluru,6 Mar 2011," 23.4  Is this game turning? Kohli is run out. Not the first time we have seen poor running from the Indian top-order. Short ball, turning away from Yuvraj and he goes for the cut. He played it pretty square, in that area where no one is sure whose call it is. Kohli thought there was a single, and ran almost all the way down. However, he seemed to stutter on the way. Yuvraj was initially sold on the single, but once he saw Kohli hesitate, he himself stopped. The throw to the bowler's end was not the most accurate, but it was good enough to catch Kohli well short.  100/4 ",53,82,3,0,64.15
V Kohli,caught,KD Mills,AJ McKay,0,2,New Zealand,Bengaluru,7 Dec 2010," 9.6  McKay has two! Kohli is gone for a duck after having scored 50 or more in his four previous innings. McKay's energy shows as he bowls another bouncer, angled across Kohli, who goes for the hook, gets a chunky top edge to Mills at long leg. New Zealand are right back  68/2 ",2,3,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,not out,,,63,2,New Zealand,Vadodara,4 Dec 2010,,70,83,6,2,90.00
V Kohli,caught,TM Dilshan,TM Dilshan,35,2,Sri Lanka,Mumbai,2 Apr 2011," 21.4  Dilshan! He's taken a blinder off his own bowling! Kohli drives and tries to get it back past the bowler, towards long-on, but Dilshan just sticks his right hand up in the air, almost in front of the non-striker's face, and plucks a magnificent catch! Could that be a decisive moment? It could very well be!  114/3 ",49,69,4,0,71.42
V Kohli,caught,JM How,AJ McKay,105,1,New Zealand,Guwahati,28 Nov 2010," 43.6  Virat falls after another big innings. Short and wide; the slower bouncer, he reached out to tamely tap it to cover! A highest of 37 in seven games but he has changed things around now with two consecutive hundreds.  250/5 ",104,162,10,0,100.96
V Kohli,caught,AD Mathews,NLTC Perera,37,2,Sri Lanka,Dambulla,28 Aug 2010," 21.1  Perera, the Indian Specialist, strikes. It was the short-of-length delivery cutting away like a leg cutter and Virat went for the pull. Too late. The ball flew of the edge to third man. Gone! Vital vital moment this  109/4 ",57,98,5,0,64.91
V Kohli,caught,LRPL Taylor,AJ McKay,64,2,New Zealand,Jaipur,1 Dec 2010," 36.5  smart work by Taylor at midwicket, short and it seemed it was on its way for the fourth boundary of the over, pulled hard but Taylor leapt, palmed it with one hand and clasped it with both on its way down to complete a neat catch, no third straight ton for Kohli though he looked good to get it  203/2 ",73,78,8,0,87.67
V Kohli,caught,JR Hopes,JW Hastings,118,2,Australia,Visakhapatnam,20 Oct 2010," 43.2  Kohli has holed out with the task unaccomplished but he has certainly set the game up for India, full on middle and he smacks it cleanly but straight into the hands of Hopes at long-on  256/4 ",121,193,11,1,97.52
V Kohli,caught,GJ Hopkins,TG Southee,8,1,New Zealand,Dambulla,25 Aug 2010," 5.4  Virat is stunned. He doesn't move. He stares at the umpire Ashoka. He looks at his partner. Now he stirs into action and walks away slowly. Very slowly. This is what happened: It was a length delivery just outside off stump and Virat pushed out at it, bat away from the body. The keeper went up straight away. The fatal finger went up. Got to see the replays to confirm the edge. Replays in: There was some noise plus the snickometer shows there was a nick!  27/2 ",16,22,1,0,50.00
V Kohli,caught,KC Sangakkara,SL Malinga,28,1,Sri Lanka,Dambulla,24 Jun 2010," 18.2  Malinga takes out Virat. It kicked up outside off from short of length and Virat stabbed at it, bat away from the body. Edge and gone!  100/2 ",34,57,4,0,82.35
V Kohli,bowled,,Saeed Ajmal,18,2,Pakistan,Dambulla,19 Jun 2010," 17.4  played on! Kohli looks to cut, but it is too full, and he duly gets a bottom edge. Looks at the pitch , suggesting perhaps that it stayed low, but it wasn't the correct shot. He misread the length and paid the price  82/2 ",27,31,1,0,66.66
V Kohli,caught,BMAJ Mendis,T Thushara,68,1,Sri Lanka,Harare,5 Jun 2010," 34.2  finally the frustration of finding the fielders again and again has got to Kohli. Looks to clear long-off this time, but doesn't get any power in this shot and holes out, Jeewan Mendis taking a nice safe catch  171/4 ",95,123,5,0,71.57
V Kohli,caught,KC Sangakkara,CRD Fernando,0,2,Sri Lanka,Dambulla,16 Aug 2010, 9.6  What a lovely catch from Sanga! Fernando teased Kohli with a fuller delivery outside off stump and he fell for the bait. He edged the intended off drive and Sanga flew full stretch with an outstretched right hand to pouch that. What a stunner!  31/2 ,3,5,0,0,0.00
V Kohli,caught,CRD Fernando,S Randiv,82,2,Sri Lanka,Bulawayo,30 May 2010," 37.4  Kohli has missed out on a century here! He wants to finish this early, comes down the track to play the lofted shot, but gets too close to the pitch of the ball, and doesn't get the desired elevation and holes out to long-on  201/3 ",92,125,4,0,89.13
V Kohli,caught,KC Sangakkara,MF Maharoof,10,1,Sri Lanka,Dambulla,22 Jun 2010," 14.3  he's a goner this time! Maharoof keeps it outside off, moved away ever so slightly from off stump and it was enough to fox Kohli, and get the edge as he prodded unconvincingly off the back foot. Sangakkara leaps in joy after pouching it, and that's another failure for Kohli in the Asia Cup.  75/2 ",14,13,1,0,71.42
V Kohli,stumped,Mushfiqur Rahim,Shakib Al Hasan,11,2,Bangladesh,Dambulla,16 Jun 2010," 14.4  lovely bit of bowling from Shakib! Flight outside off and turn, luring Kohli forward and breaking past his off stump. His back foot strayed out of the crease and he could not get back entirely in time. Toes on the line, bails in the air. Third umpire takes  a few close looks at it and says Kohli is out.  80/2 ",22,35,0,0,50.00
V Kohli,caught,MV Boucher,DW Steyn,57,2,South Africa,Ahmedabad,27 Feb 2010," 27.6  edged and taken! Steyn gets another! Kohli looks to steer this one down to third man, the bowl holds its line a touch, and gets a regulation edge for a regulation catch for Boucher  157/5 ",71,0,4,1,80.28
V Kohli,run out,,,0,1,Zimbabwe,Bulawayo,28 May 2010," 9.3  Kohli is run out. It was reverse paddled towards short third man and they decide to get across for the risky single. Chigumbura, who has had an awful time with the ball so far, fires in a lovely direct hit .. Kohli tried to dive back into the crease but couldn't beat the throw. Out without facing a ball. In street cricket, if you had owned the bat, you would have taken it and walked off in a huff!  57/2 ",0,3,0,0,-
